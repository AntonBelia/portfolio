# Full-Stack Project Portfolio: React, Node.js, Express, and SQL

## Project Description

This project is a full-stack application that combines both client-side and server-side components. The client-side is implemented using the React library, responsible for rendering the user interface and interacting with it. The server-side is built on Node.js and Express, handling client requests and database interactions. SQL is used as the database technology.

The project is deployed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), providing high availability and scalability. Various GCP services are utilized to ensure reliability and security, such as Google App Engine, Google Cloud SQL.

## Functionality

This application demonstrates the developer's skills in key aspects of web development:

 - Creating and interacting with a database using SQL.
 - Developing a user interface with React library.
 - Building the server-side of the application using Node.js and Express.
 - Testing code using Cypress, and React Testing Library.
 - Deployment and management of the application on the Google Cloud Platform.
